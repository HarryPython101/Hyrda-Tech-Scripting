This script has been created by Eric Mayo exclusively for the use of the Gull Lake High School Cyberpatriot team HydraTech .
use of this script by any other teams or people for the cyberpatriot competition is strictly prohibited. If you do so you accept all
responsibility for any rule breaches you may cause and the consequences of such. If you wish to use my script as a reference to write
yourr own that is perfectly acceptable. However I would request that you at least make an effort to understand what they commands
do and why they are there before using them.
